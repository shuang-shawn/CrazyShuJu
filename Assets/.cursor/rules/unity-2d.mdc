# 2D Top-Down Standards
- Always use **Vector2** for movement logic unless Z-axis depth is required.
<!-- - Use `Rigidbody2D.MovePosition` for physics-based movement to avoid jitter. -->
- For animations, use **Blend Trees** with 'Horizontal', 'Vertical', and 'Speed' parameters.
- Ensure all sprite-related code accounts for **Pixel Perfect** settings.
- Prefer the **New Input System** (Input Actions) over `Input.GetAxis`.
